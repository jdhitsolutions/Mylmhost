    About_Mylmhost

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    This PowerShell module contains a set of functions for working with the
    legacy lmhosts file.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The purpose of this file was to provide name resolution for Netbios
    computer names. Normally, this file is irrelevant in today's networking but
    remains a legacy artifact. If you do not have a file already created,
    one will be the first time you run Set-LmhostsEntry.

    There may be a few scenarios where using lmhosts still has value. You can
    use this file to provide name resolution for a computer that otherwise
    can't be resolved. For example, if you are running a virtual machine on a
    private or NAT'd network, you can't normally resolve the name. But by adding an lmhosts entry, you can.

    Once you can resolve the name, then you can create a PSSession using the
    computer name instead of the IPAddress.

    THE COMMANDS
    The commands will convert lmhosts entries into custom objects

    PS C:\> Get-LmhostsEntry chi-dc01

    Computername IPAddress
    ------------ ---------
    chi-dc01     172.16.30.200

    Or you can use the -Raw parameter to display the information as it appears
    in the lmhosts file.

    When running a command that will modify the lmhosts file, a backup copy
    will automatically be created in the System32 folder. The backup copy will
    be overwritten as needed.

    LIMITATIONS
    It is assumed that your lmhosts file is well formed and that you do not
    have duplicate computer names and IP addresses. It is also assumed that any
    comments, using the # character, start at the beginning of the line.

    These commands do not take into account any directives like INCLUDE, #PRE
    OR #DOM.
